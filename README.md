Purpose of Project:

    This project was created to showcase my proficiency in the use of React and multiple,
    complimentary libraries. Using React, Redux, and React Router in parallel with a
    Flask Rest API backend (cryptoplatformBE can be found at "https://github.com/jordansoif/cryptoplatformBE") has allowed me to create a web app in which I can simulate the purchase,
    sale, and management of cryptocurrencies. This project features a user creator/login, a trading system that allows users to simulate purchasing and storing cryptocurrencies, API calls to
    Binance for current currency pricing, and a plethora of other features.

    Thank you for your interest in my project, the instructions to properly run the app are included below.

How To Run (Windows):

    1. Install all dependancies:
        Run "npm i" in the cmd terminal

    2. Open and run cryptoplatformBE ("https://github.com/jordansoif/cryptoplatformBE"):
        This is required for creating and logging into a user, which unlocks the rest of
        the app for usage. Instructions to run the backend are included in the README.md
        of the cryptoplatformBE project

    3. Once the backend is running, launch cryptoplatformFE:
        Run "npm run dev" in the cmd terminal. This will run parcel and create a localhost
        that can be viewed in a browser of your choosing.
